# UX-Portfolio

IMT 549 Spring 2020

Creator: Cheng Feng Sun

This website is created to my UX work and projects I did on the side.

About me:

Iâ€™m based in Seattle but originally hail from the lively city of Taipei, Taiwan.

When I'm not working, you can find me reading, taking photos, drawing people, and probably petting dogs that are not mine.

Thanks for stopping by and feel free to reach out.
